================================================================================
SIMPLE STRATEGIC LIQUIDITY GAME ANALYSIS
Economic Scenario: normal
Base Suspicion Level: 0.5
Network: 142 companies, 226 debt relationships
================================================================================

1. NETWORK STRUCTURE
----------------------------------------
Total cycles: 66
Companies in cycles: 46
Hub nodes (5+ cycles): 24
Mega hub nodes (10+ cycles): 15
Max cycle participation: 42

2. SIMULATION WITHOUT BANK INTERVENTION
----------------------------------------
Total payments made: 3600
Total payments delayed: 19000
Payment rate: 15.9%
Total payment volume: $1,395,551,804.47
Average final reputation: 0.735
Average final suspicion: 0.735

3. SIMULATION WITH BANK INTERVENTION
----------------------------------------
Total payments made: 16617
Total payments delayed: 5983
Payment rate: 73.5%
Total payment volume: $6,588,839,084.76
Cycles resolved: 6600
Average final reputation: 0.959
Average final suspicion: 0.315

4. BANK INTERVENTION IMPACT
----------------------------------------
Payment increase: +361.6%
Volume increase: +372.1%
Suspicion reduction: +0.421
Payment rate improvement: +57.6 percentage points

5. KEY INSIGHTS
----------------------------------------
✓ Bank intervention successfully broke payment gridlock
✓ Guaranteed cycle payments reduced overall suspicion
✓ Lower suspicion led to more payments throughout network

Scenario Impact (normal):
- Moderate suspicion still impacted payment efficiency
- Bank intervention improved overall liquidity

Mechanism:
1. High suspicion → companies delay payments (even with sufficient capital)
2. Delays → increased suspicion → more delays (negative spiral)
3. Bank guarantees cycle payments → breaks the spiral
4. Successful payments → reduced suspicion → more voluntary payments
