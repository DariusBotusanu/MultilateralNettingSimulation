SIMPLE STRATEGIC LIQUIDITY GAME ANALYSIS
Economic Scenario: boom
Base Suspicion Level: 0.1
Network: 142 companies, 226 debt relationships
================================================================================

1. NETWORK STRUCTURE
----------------------------------------
Total cycles: 66
Companies in cycles: 46
Hub nodes (5+ cycles): 24
Mega hub nodes (10+ cycles): 15
Max cycle participation: 42

2. SIMULATION WITHOUT BANK INTERVENTION
----------------------------------------
Total payments made: 22069
Total payments delayed: 531
Payment rate: 97.7%
Total payment volume: $8,897,120,515.06
Average final reputation: 1.000
Average final suspicion: 0.052

3. SIMULATION WITH BANK INTERVENTION
----------------------------------------
Total payments made: 22206
Total payments delayed: 394
Payment rate: 98.3%
Total payment volume: $8,928,078,105.35
Cycles resolved: 6600
Average final reputation: 1.000
Average final suspicion: 0.048

4. BANK INTERVENTION IMPACT
----------------------------------------
Payment increase: +0.6%
Volume increase: +0.3%
Suspicion reduction: +0.004
Payment rate improvement: +0.6 percentage points

5. KEY INSIGHTS
----------------------------------------
✓ Bank intervention successfully broke payment gridlock
✓ Guaranteed cycle payments reduced overall suspicion
✓ Lower suspicion led to more payments throughout network

Scenario Impact (boom):
- Moderate suspicion still impacted payment efficiency
- Bank intervention improved overall liquidity

Mechanism:
1. High suspicion → companies delay payments (even with sufficient capital)
2. Delays → increased suspicion → more delays (negative spiral)
3. Bank guarantees cycle payments → breaks the spiral
4. Successful payments → reduced suspicion → more voluntary payments
