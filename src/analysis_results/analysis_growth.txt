SIMPLE STRATEGIC LIQUIDITY GAME ANALYSIS
Economic Scenario: growth
Base Suspicion Level: 0.3
Network: 142 companies, 226 debt relationships
================================================================================

1. NETWORK STRUCTURE
----------------------------------------
Total cycles: 66
Companies in cycles: 46
Hub nodes (5+ cycles): 24
Mega hub nodes (10+ cycles): 15
Max cycle participation: 42

2. SIMULATION WITHOUT BANK INTERVENTION
----------------------------------------
Total payments made: 13390
Total payments delayed: 9210
Payment rate: 59.2%
Total payment volume: $5,382,721,213.75
Average final reputation: 0.772
Average final suspicion: 0.317

3. SIMULATION WITH BANK INTERVENTION
----------------------------------------
Total payments made: 20998
Total payments delayed: 1602
Payment rate: 92.9%
Total payment volume: $8,430,027,398.81
Cycles resolved: 6600
Average final reputation: 1.000
Average final suspicion: 0.149

4. BANK INTERVENTION IMPACT
----------------------------------------
Payment increase: +56.8%
Volume increase: +56.6%
Suspicion reduction: +0.168
Payment rate improvement: +33.7 percentage points

5. KEY INSIGHTS
----------------------------------------
✓ Bank intervention successfully broke payment gridlock
✓ Guaranteed cycle payments reduced overall suspicion
✓ Lower suspicion led to more payments throughout network

Scenario Impact (growth):
- Moderate suspicion still impacted payment efficiency
- Bank intervention improved overall liquidity

Mechanism:
1. High suspicion → companies delay payments (even with sufficient capital)
2. Delays → increased suspicion → more delays (negative spiral)
3. Bank guarantees cycle payments → breaks the spiral
4. Successful payments → reduced suspicion → more voluntary payments
