SIMPLE STRATEGIC LIQUIDITY GAME ANALYSIS
Economic Scenario: recession
Base Suspicion Level: 0.7
Network: 142 companies, 226 debt relationships
================================================================================

1. NETWORK STRUCTURE

Companies in cycles: 46
Hub nodes (5+ cycles): 24
Mega hub nodes (10+ cycles): 15
Max cycle participation: 42

2. SIMULATION WITHOUT BANK INTERVENTION
----------------------------------------
Total payments made: 1735
Total payments delayed: 20865
Payment rate: 7.7%
Total payment volume: $696,285,840.93
Average final reputation: 0.765
Average final suspicion: 0.856

3. SIMULATION WITH BANK INTERVENTION
----------------------------------------
Total payments made: 13989
Total payments delayed: 8611
Payment rate: 61.9%
Total payment volume: $5,621,908,568.60
Cycles resolved: 6600
Average final reputation: 0.930
Average final suspicion: 0.524

4. BANK INTERVENTION IMPACT
----------------------------------------
Payment increase: +706.3%
Volume increase: +707.4%
Suspicion reduction: +0.333
Payment rate improvement: +54.2 percentage points

5. KEY INSIGHTS
----------------------------------------
✓ Bank intervention successfully broke payment gridlock
✓ Guaranteed cycle payments reduced overall suspicion
✓ Lower suspicion led to more payments throughout network

Scenario Impact (recession):
- High initial suspicion created severe payment gridlock
- Bank intervention critical for maintaining payment flows

Mechanism:
1. High suspicion → companies delay payments (even with sufficient capital)
2. Delays → increased suspicion → more delays (negative spiral)
3. Bank guarantees cycle payments → breaks the spiral
4. Successful payments → reduced suspicion → more voluntary payments
